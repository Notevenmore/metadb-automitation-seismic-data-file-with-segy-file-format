## Description

The side bar in this demo was made for testing purposes only. It has successfully implemented the full height with the navbar present without having to 
scroll the page along with easy implementation of responsiveness if necessary (collapse when window size is shrinked to a certain size). 

All of the ToDos has been successfully implemented in Next with Tailwind as the CSS framework. 

**The demo of the page can be viewed from [this link, hosted in Vercel](https://gtn-frontend.vercel.app/). Docker was not used since this project is still at early development stage.**
